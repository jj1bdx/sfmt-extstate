=================================================================

* Tested on FreeBSD/i386 7.3-RELEASE with 
  gcc44 (GCC) 4.4.4 20100427 from the Port lang/gcc44.

* Features removed

 * AltIvec support is removed; no test environment.

 * SFMT RNG period is fixed to ((2^19937)-1). Parameters of
   the original SFMT-1.3.3 code are applicable with little modification.
   (Code also tested with the ((2^216091)-1) RNG period.)

 * 64-bit RNG support is removed to simplify the internal state
   handling.  Mixing up 32- and 64-bit RNG generations can be fatal
   for the whole generation process.

* Why externalized state table needed?

The original SFMT code embedded the internal state table of SFMT as a
static array; this made the whole code thread-unsafe and unable to be
included into other pieces of software such as a part of Erlang
linked-in drivers.

In the functions of sfmt-extstate-*.c, the programmers need to
explicitly pass the pointer of the SFMT internal state table.  This will
allow the programmers to separate the memory regions for the state
tables when multiple instances of SFMT generators are concurrently
running.
